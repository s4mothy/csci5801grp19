## Item 3: Better Reordering Problems ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to generate more complicated reorder problems.
- So that: my students don't find them too easy to solve.

## Item 4: Source Code Line Exclusion ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to choose lines of the source code to ignore.
- So that: I can prevent problems from being made that cannot be solved or are too easy for the students to solve.

## Item 6: Stored Problem Reusability ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to reuse some old problems in new problem set requests.
- So that: I can create sets of problems for my students without needing as much source code.

## Item 7: Customization for Stored Problem Reuse ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able choose when and how many problems in a set are reused and how many are newly generated.
- So that: I can exclusively use new problems when I want to, but also have the option to reuse old ones.

## Item 8: Multiple Source Code Language Options ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to utilize multiple source code languages, other than Python.
- So that: students with varied backgrounds in different programming languages have other options for quizzes.

## Item 9: Source Code Solution Handling ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to add the file's output at the top of each source file.
- So that: the correct solution are included for each generated problem.

## Item 10: Improved Mutations for Multiple Choice Problems ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to have multiple choice problems with better mutated options.
- So that: the mutated options are neither too easy nor too hard for my students to find the correct option.

## Item 11: Customizable Comment Handling for Fill-In-The-Blank Problems ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: choose if a fill-in-the-blank problem prints out the comments in the source code or not.
- So that: I can hide comments if they give away the answer and show comments if they are necessary to understand the problem.

## Item 12: Problem Rework for Consistent Implementations ##

- As a: Developer
- I want to: be able to quickly comprehend what is different in the function of each problem constructor.
- So that: if new problem types are requested, I can implement them more easily in future.

## Item 13: Extending Language Tables and Handling Within Problem Classes to Additional Languages ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to utilize additional languages and be aware what keywords the system can recognize.
- So that: I am aware what languages are available and what, if any keywords I should avoid.

## Item 14: Integer Recognition for Problems ##

- As a: Instructor
- I want to: be able to have the system identify integers when parsing source code during problem generation.
- So that: I can create problems where changes in an integers value are part of its generation.
