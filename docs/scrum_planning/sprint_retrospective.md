# Sprint Retrospective #

## What Worked Well ##

Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blank problems were successfully generated and added in a properly formatted quiz document, so the desired behavior on the surface is met. Consistent meetings helped ensure some general progress was made, and issues were caught earlier than they would have been without the sprints.

## What Must Be Improved ##

Some functional behavior for the two problem types are still not perfect, outputs need to be properly analyzed for incorrectly generated problems. Additional features promised in the specification have not yet been met and additional sprints to work on meeting these goals are necessary. Furthermore, due to the problems being handled by different parties and solutions being applied to different parts at different times, a rework of the system to ensure consistent application of problem generation seems necessary at some point.
